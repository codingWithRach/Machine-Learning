We can use this to interpret or quantify the result of the test, and either reject or fail to reject H0.  This is done by conmparing the p-value to a threshold value chosen beforehand, called the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level is often referred to by the Greek lower case letter alpha, and a common value is 5% or 0.05.  A smaller alpha value suggests a more robust interpretation of the result, such as 1% or 0.01\n",

    "- True or False Null Hypothesis - the interpretation of the p-value does not mean that H0 is true or false.  It means that we have chosen to reject, or fail to reject, H0 at a specific statistical significance level based on empirical evidence an the chosen statistical test.\n",
    "- p-value as Probability - a common misunderstanding is that the p-value is a probability of H0 being true or false given the data.  This is incorrect: it is the probability of the data given the pre-specified assumption embedded in the statistica test i.e. Pr(data | hypothesis).  It allows us to reason whether or not the data fits the hypothesis, not the other way round.\n",
    "- Post-Hoc Tuning - you can NOT re-sample your domain or tune your data sample and re-run the statistical test until you achieve a desired result.  You can NOT choose your p-value after you run the test.  This is at best unethical, and at worst fraud."
