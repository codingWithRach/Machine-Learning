    "Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate the skill of machine learning models on a limited data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into.  As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a popular method because it is simple to understand, and generally results in a less biased or less optimistic estimate of the model skill than other methods (such as a simple train/test split)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. shuffle the dataset randomly\n",
    "2. split the dataset into k groups of approximately equal size\n",
    "3. for each unique group\n",
    "- take the group as a hold out or test data set\n",
    "- take the remaining groups as a training data set\n",
    "- fit a model on the training set\n",
    "- evaluate the model on the test set\n",
    "- retain the evaluation score and discard the model\n",
    "4. summarise the skill of the model using the sample of model evauation scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, each observation in the data sample is assigned to an individual group, and stays in that group for the duration of the procedure.  Thus each sample has the opportunity to be used in the test set once, and in the training set (k-1) times\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that any preparation of the data prior to fitting the model occur on the cross-validation-assigned training dataset within the loop, rather than on the broader dataset.  This prevents data leakage and an optimistic estimate of the model skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of a k-fold cross-validation run are often summarised with the mean of the model skill scores.  It is also good practice to include a measure of the variance, such as the standard deivation or standard error."

    "# Configuration of k\n",
    "The k-value must be chosen carefully for your data sample.  A poorly chosen value may result in a mis-representative idea of the skill of the model (e.g. high variance), or a high bias (e.g. overestimate of skill).  Common tactics for choosing k:\n",
    "- Representative - k is chosen such that each train/test group of data samples is large enough to be statistically representative of the broader dataset\n",
    "- k=10 - this value has been found through experimentation to generally result in a model skill estiamte with low bias and a modest variance\n",
    "- k=n - this gives each test sample an opportunity to be used in the test set.  This approach is called leave-one-out cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of k is usually 5 or 10, but there is no formal rule.  As k gets larger, the difference in size between the training set and resampling subsets gets smaller, and the bias of the technique reduces.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are struggling to choose a value, k=10 is recommended.  However, it is preferable to split the data sample into k groups with the same number of samples if possible, such that the sample of model skill scores are all equivalent."

    "- Fold2: [0.1, 0.3]\n",
    "- Fold3: [0.4, 0.6]\n",

    "Use the sample to evaluate the skill of a machine learning algorithm.  Three models are trainiend and evaluated, with each fold given a chance to be the test set:\n",

    "- Model2: trained on Fold2 + Fold3, Tested on Fold1\n",
    "- Model3: trained on Fold1 + Fold3, Tested on Fold2\n",
    "\n",
    "The models are discarded after they are evaluated.  The skill scores are collected for each model and summarised for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not need to implement k-fold cross-validation manually.  The scikit-learn library provides the KFold() class to split a given data sample.  It takes as arguments:\n",
    "- the number of splits\n",
    "- whether or not to shuffle the sample\n",
    "- the seed for the pseudorandom number generator used prior to the shuffle\n",
    "\n",
    "The split() function can then be called repeatedly on the class, where the data sample is provided as an argument.  Arrays are returned containing the indices into the original data sample of observations to use for train and test sets on each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the k-fold cross-validation implementation in scikit-learn is provided as a component operation within broader methods, such as grid-searching model hyperparameters and scoring a model on a dataset."
